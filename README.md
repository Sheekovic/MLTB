MLTB: Machine Learning Trading Bot
This project is a machine learning trading bot that uses historical cryptocurrency data to make predictions on future prices. The bot uses five different models to make predictions: K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Linear Regression, and Ridge.

Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following:

Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-Learn
Matplotlib
Usage
To use the machine learning trading bot, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the MLTB.py script using python MLTB.py.
Follow the prompts to enter the cryptocurrency symbol and date range for the historical data.
The bot will train the models and output the predictions for the next 30 days.
The bot will save the predictions to a CSV file in the project directory.
Results
The machine learning trading bot achieves high accuracy with all five models, with accuracy ranging from 98.8% to 99.8%. The bot can be used to make predictions on a variety of cryptocurrencies and date ranges.
